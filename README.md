## Challange Question from chapter 13 
## 1- Blank Row Inserter
A program blankRowInserter.py that takes two integers  as command line arguments. Letâ€™s call the first integer N and the second integer M. 
Starting at row N, the program should insert M blank rows into the spreadsheet.

## Packages to install
1. openpyxl: Python module for working with excel files. [install](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
2. pyinputplus: Python module for validating user inputs. [install](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/)

## Code Description:
- Open the excel file, select active sheet, find max rows and max_cols
- Take input from user to enter 
	1. starting_empty_row = Row number from which he/she wants to add empty rows. Note: this number can not be greather than max_rows
	2. num_of_emtpy_row = How many blank rows he/she want to add
- Check if the starting_empty_row number is greather than max_rows or not
	1. If greater: Then exits the program because its does not sence to add empty rows at end
	2. If not greather: The keep the operations going
- Create new_sheet to store our new formated data
- now we have to copy data from our main sheet to new_sheet 
- copy every row from main sheet to new_sheet
- But if the starting_empty_row reaches then whe should leave  (num_empty_row) rows blank and add our data at the row number (row + num_empty_row)
- And Finnaly save our changes
